# pulses_GUI

This code runs a  GUI that allows users to perform pulsed quantum experiments on diamond nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles:
- Rabi oscillations (change resonant radio frequency pulse duration)
- Ramsey fringes (change delay time between resonant radio frequency pi/2 pulses)
- Spin echo (change delay time between resonant pi/2 pulses and refocusing pi pulse)
- Double electron electron resonance (spin echo with either CW or pulsed external spin control)
